a community app where citizens can post and vote on local development ideas
create a website name CivicLink which solves this problem statement “Transparency in Civic Problem-Solving”

Citizens frequently report problems (like potholes, waste management, or unsafe areas), but there is poor transparency on whether these are acknowledged or resolved.

Problem: Create an open civic tracking system where users can post issues with location tags, track their progress, and rate responses from local authorities — promoting accountability and trust.

My solution is to create a website which will be controlled by the government at the highest level 
But at base level it will work for the local citizens of a nation. The idea is to build such a website in which the common people ( login with aadhar no.) will be allowed to upload the problems in a particular area around them ( in the form of texts or picture) and the people will only upvote that problem to prove the validity of that problem. When the issue is upvoted by 60% population of that area then it will be considered as a valid problem and then it will submitted to the area secretary or municipal corporation office. If the municipal corporation doesn't resolve the problem within a given period of time then it will be submitted to the state government and if they're are also not able to resolve it then it will go to the highest authority i.e., central government, so that it it anyhow resolved. 

This is my base idea now you need to provide me the entire website or provide the code for frontend, database and backend everything. And tell me each and every step to completely publish that website in the easiest way possible.
